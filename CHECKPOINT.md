## Current Status: Phase 4 COMPLETE ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-28 14:00 UTC

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Backend Authentication System ✅
- ✅ Installed authentication packages (bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, express-session, cookie-parser)
- ✅ Created users table with role field (admin, editor, viewer)
- ✅ Implemented authentication middleware (authenticateToken, authorizeRole)
- ✅ Created auth endpoints:
  - POST /api/auth/register
  - POST /api/auth/login
  - POST /api/auth/logout
  - GET /api/auth/me
- ✅ Added JWT token generation (8-hour expiry)
- ✅ Added bcrypt password hashing (10 rounds)
- ✅ First user auto-promoted to admin
- ✅ Database migration for created_by column in videos table

### Other Completed Features
- ✅ Collapse/expand functionality for user lists
- ✅ Username + Display Name format (@username — Display Name)
- ✅ Video management system with upload, metadata, and streaming
- ✅ Video search by title and description

## Phase 1 Test Results ✅

**Server Status**: Running successfully on port 3000 (Process ID: 78ec58)

### Test 1: Register First User (Auto-Admin)
- ✅ User created with ID: 1
- ✅ Username: admin
- ✅ Role: admin (auto-promoted)
- ✅ Password hashing working

### Test 2: Login
- ✅ Login successful with correct credentials
- ✅ JWT token generated
- ✅ Token stored in HTTP-only cookie
- ✅ User info returned (id, username, email, role)

### Test 3: /me Endpoint (Authentication Verification)
- ✅ JWT token from cookie validated
- ✅ User info retrieved: admin (role: admin)
- ✅ Last login timestamp recorded
- ✅ Created at timestamp present

### Test 4: Register Second User (Default Role)
- ✅ User created with ID: 2
- ✅ Username: editor1
- ✅ Role: viewer (default, not admin)
- ✅ Different users get different roles as expected

### Test 5: Logout
- ✅ Logout endpoint working
- ✅ Cookie cleared successfully
- ✅ Success message returned

**All Phase 1 authentication tests passed!**

### Phase 2: Role-Based Authorization ✅ COMPLETE

**Server Status**: Running successfully on port 3000 (Process ID: 8ff399)

#### Endpoints Protected:
**Groups API:**
- GET /api/groups - All authenticated users
- POST /api/groups - Editor+ only
- PUT /api/groups/:id - Editor+ only
- DELETE /api/groups/:id - Admin only
- POST /api/groups/:id/usernames - Editor+ only
- DELETE /api/usernames/:username/:category - Editor+ only

**Search & Export:**
- GET /api/search - All authenticated users
- GET /api/usernames/check/:username - All authenticated users
- GET /api/export/json - Editor+ only
- GET /api/export/csv - Editor+ only
- POST /api/import/json - Editor+ only
- GET /api/statistics - All authenticated users

**Videos API:**
- GET /api/videos - All authenticated users
- GET /api/videos/search/:query - All authenticated users
- GET /api/videos/:id - All authenticated users
- POST /api/videos - Editor+ only (stores created_by)
- PUT /api/videos/:id - Editor+ only (ownership check: editors can only edit own)
- DELETE /api/videos/:id - Editor+ only (ownership check: editors can only delete own)
- GET /api/videos/:id/stream - All authenticated users

#### Test Results:
- ✅ Unauthenticated access blocked
- ✅ Admin can access all endpoints
- ✅ Viewer cannot create groups (403 Forbidden)
- ✅ Admin can create groups successfully
- ✅ Video uploads store created_by field
- ✅ Ownership checks work for video edit/delete

### Phase 3: Frontend Authentication ✅ COMPLETE

**Implementation Details:**

#### Login/Register UI
- Created modern authentication page with tab interface
- Login form with username/password
- Register form with username, email, full name, password
- Error message display for validation failures
- Info message showing first user becomes admin
- Responsive design with dark mode support

#### Authentication State Management
- `currentUser` - Stores authenticated user data
- `isAuthenticated` - Boolean flag for auth status
- `checkAuth()` - Verifies authentication on page load
- `showAuthPage()` / `showMainApp()` - Toggle between auth and main views

#### Authentication Functions
- `login()` - Authenticate user with credentials
- `register()` - Create new user account (auto-login after)
- `logout()` - Clear session and return to login
- `switchAuthTab()` - Toggle between login/register forms

#### UI Updates
- Main app hidden until authenticated
- User info display showing name and role
- Logout button in header
- Automatic redirect based on auth status
- Page initialization checks authentication first

#### Features
- HTTP-only cookie-based authentication
- Credentials automatically included in all requests
- Auto-login after successful registration
- Clear error messages for failed auth attempts
- Session persistence across page reloads

**Test Flow:**
1. Page loads → Checks authentication
2. If not authenticated → Shows login/register page
3. User logs in/registers → Receives JWT cookie
4. Main app loads → Displays user info
5. Logout → Clears session and returns to login

### Phase 4: User Management & Role-Based UI ✅ COMPLETE

**Implementation Details:**

#### User Management API Endpoints (Admin Only)
- `GET /api/users` - List all users with details
- `PUT /api/users/:id/role` - Update user role (admin, editor, viewer)
- `PUT /api/users/:id/status` - Activate/deactivate user accounts
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete user (with safeguards)

**Protection Features:**
- Cannot modify own role or status
- Cannot delete own account
- Cannot delete last admin user
- All operations require admin role

#### Video Creator Tracking
- All video GET endpoints now include creator information
- `creator_username` and `creator_name` fields added to video responses
- LEFT JOIN with users table to retrieve creator details
- Display shows "Created by: [name]" on each video card

#### Role-Based UI Visibility
- **Users Tab**: Visible only to admins
- **Viewers**: All create/edit/delete buttons disabled
  - Cannot add usernames, create groups, or upload videos
  - Cannot import/export data
  - Read-only access to all content
- **Editors**: Can manage own content
  - Video delete button disabled for videos they don't own
  - Full access to groups and own videos
- **Admins**: Full access to all features

#### User Management Dashboard (Admin Only)
- Modern card-based user list interface
- Display shows: full name, email, username, role, status
- Last login and join date information
- Role change dropdown (admin, editor, viewer)
- Activate/Deactivate toggle button
- Delete button with confirmation
- Color-coded role badges
- Inactive status indicator

**Location**:
- Backend: `server.js:422-547` (User management API)
- Backend: `server.js:1043-1099` (Video creator info)
- Frontend: `public/index.html:974-1058` (User CSS)
- Frontend: `public/index.html:1254-1260` (User HTML section)
- Frontend: `public/index.html:1537-1592` (Role-based UI logic)
- Frontend: `public/index.html:3119-3270` (User management JS)

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Admin can view all users
- ✅ Admin can change user roles
- ✅ Admin can activate/deactivate users
- ✅ Admin can delete users (with safeguards)
- ✅ Users tab hidden from non-admins
- ✅ Viewer buttons properly disabled
- ✅ Video creator information displayed
- ✅ Role-based delete button visibility working

## Next Steps

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

## Notes

- ✅ Server running successfully on port 3000
- ✅ Database migrations working correctly
- ✅ First user auto-promotion to admin working
- ✅ Default user role (viewer) assigned correctly

- Ready to begin Phase 2: Role-Based Authorization

## Summary

Phase 1 of the authentication system is complete and tested. The backend now has:
- User registration and login working
- JWT token authentication
- Role-based user accounts (admin, editor, viewer)
- Automatic admin promotion for first user
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Session management
- Authentication middleware ready for use

**Next**: Begin Phase 2 to add role-based authorization to existing API endpoints.
